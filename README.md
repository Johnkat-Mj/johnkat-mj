## Hi there 👋

# Hey, I'm John KATEMBUE aka Johnkat MJ 👋

I’m a **frontend-focused developer** passionate about creating tools, starter kits, and UI workflows that save developers time.
Most of my work revolves around **JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystems**, with some projects in **Laravel**; I also work heavily with **React/NextJS, Vue/Nuxt**, and I’m currently exploring **NestJS & Remix (React Router 7)**.

### 🚀 What I’m building

* **Flexilla** & **Flexilla Alpine** → Headless interactive component library for VanillaJS + AlpineJS support (with plugins).
* **Flexiwind CLI** (soon) → Like shadcn CLI but for PHP developers.
* **UnoUI (aka UnifyUI)** (WIP) → Modern and beautiful blocks/components for UnoCSS.
* **Flexiwind HTML** (WIP) → Tailwind CSS components & blocks for modern development.
* **Flexiwind Laravel** (WIP) → Beautiful, accessible UI components for Laravel, built with Tailwind CSS v4. Supports both Blade and Livewire. Inspired by Shadcn, fully open source.

### 🌌 Tech I work with

* **Frontend:** NextJS, Astro, Vue/Nuxt, Tailwind, AlpineJS, Livewire
* **Backend & Fullstack:** Laravel, NestJS (learning), RemixJS (learning), Volt
* **Tooling & Styling:** Tailwind, UnoCSS, Shiki, component-driven design
